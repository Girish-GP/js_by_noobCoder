#Default JS Behaviour : Javascript -  synchronous & single threaded language

#Execution Context --> executes one line of code one at a time

  console.log(1)
  console.log(2)

  console log 2 waits for console log 1 to execute before Execution


# Blocking Code       Vs     Non Blocking Code

Blocks the Execution         Does not block the Execution

Read the file sync           Read the file async




Everything depends upon the useCase 

Let say we have to read a file and store it somewhere and whether it is successfully stored or not does not effects the thread of Execution i.e other codes -- here we can say that reading the file async is better


But lets say we after storing data based upon whether it is success or failure we have to perform the next operation --- here the reading file async will result in errors
